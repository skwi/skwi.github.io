## About

Hi! My name is Cedric Spalvieri.

I live in the beautifull city of Lyon ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, with a wonderful wife and two amazing ~~terrors~~ daughters.  
As far as I remember, I've always loved tweaking computer related stuff. ðŸ¤“  

This natural curiosity toward computer behavior led me to coding, and I've done it in a professional context for more than ten years now. These years spent coding in teams of various shapes made me realise than more thant the code itself, its quality lies in the people who write it. 

I'm now CTO at <a class="novaway" href="https://novaway.fr">Novaway</a>, where I try to make the most of my interest for behavioral psychology to enhance processes and practices, keeping the empowerment of the people I work with as a priority.
