Hi! My name is Cedric Spalvieri.

I am a developer fulled by dark and beer and ristretto coffee.<br/>

I live in the beautifull city of Lyon (France 🇫🇷), with a wonderful wife and two amazing daughters.  
As far as I remember, I've always loved tweaking computer related stuff 🤓 and learn new things.

This natural curiosity toward computer behavior led me to coding 👨‍💻, and I've done it in a professional context for more than ten years now. 
These years spent coding in teams of various shapes made me realise than more thant the code itself, its quality lies in the people who write it. 

I'm now CTO at <a class="novaway" href="https://novaway.fr">Novaway</a>, where I try to make the most of my interest for behavioral psychology to enhance processes and practices, keeping the empowerment of the people I work with as a priority.
