My name is Cedric Spalvieri (also known as [le_skwi](http://twitter.com/le_skwi)).

I'm the lead developer for [Novaway](http://novaway.fr) a small french web agency. This means that I mostly write code on a daily basis, but I think there is much more to my job than that. 

I've explained [in this first post](/2015/02/19/yet-another-developer-blog.html) why I started this blog.

If you are more interested in what I have to say, you can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/le_skwi) (both english and french content) or read [this more personal blog](http://blog.skwi.fr).
