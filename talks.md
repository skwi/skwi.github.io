## Talks
I'm quite new in the talk game. Nevertheless, I enjoy it because so far it has been a great opportunity to learn new things, meet wonderfull people and have fun.  
Here are the talks I've already given.  
They are in french, but I can translate them if you are really interested in the subject.  
Of course, I can also discuss the subject with french speaking people.
