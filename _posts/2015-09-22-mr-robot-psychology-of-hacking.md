Mr Robot was one of the main tv show this summer break (phrase a revoir). The plot is well ficele, image and music are great, and, as many technical people noted, the tech is pretty accurate.

It tellement accurate que they don't hack with code, but with psychology.

Of course there is some coding involved, but that's just a tool amongst  others.

As the show points out, The real hacking is done by studying human behavior in general, and the life of the people that are being hacked, not by spending lot of time writing complex algorithm

When developing applications and websites, we have to keep that in mind. The coder's job is not to write complex line of code. It's to study and understand the purpose of this coding.
